# Astronomy-Research-Papers
A repository to store astronomy research papers 

File structure:

We will each have a folder to add our submissions. I've named yours 
"ivebeenoff", but you're free to name it as you wish. Mine is named 
"gritsblitz". 

Afterwards, the next folders are named "articles" and "summaries", where
"articles" contains the pdfs of the articles we've chosen to highlight and
"summaries" contains our summary of the desired paper.
From there, we will name each article/summary "[primary author][YY(year of
publication)]_[MM-DD-YY (date of your submission to the github)]". 

For instance, I am writing this README on October 14, 2025, so if I were to
summarize my research note on this day, I would save the pdf of the research
note under "gritsblitz/articles/burt25_10-14-25.pdf". Meanwhile, my brief
summary on the manuscript would be saved under
"gritsblitz/summaries/burt25_10-14-25.txt"

I do want this naming convention to be maintained such that the files are both
tab-completable and globbable. This benefits you too. By the way, listing both
the date of submission here and the date of publication is not redundant, since
A) I want to know when the paper was published, and
B) Papers are usually dictated "[primary author] [submission year]
