Massive stars lose significant percentages of their mass throughout
their lifetimes through stellar winds. The efficacy of stellar winds
have been studied in the past, but Vink's previous research found
issues with using these perscriptions for stars with lower
metallicity, which is of particular interest when studying late-stage
phenomena involving compact binaries, such as pair-instability
supernovae(PISNe) (as this paper mentions), but also X-ray binaries,
Wolf-Rayet+O-type binaies, GWs, etc. Additionally, very massive stars
(VMS) (M > 100 M_sun) have stellar winds which are optically
thick. This paper explores the theoretical framework of these
optically thick winds.

This paper seeks to accurately describe the mass-loss of O-type stars
as they transition into Wolf-Rayet stars. It describes the VMS winds
framework to low metallicity stars, despite a lack of observations. It
offers in implementation of these winds into MESA. The paper also
makes several conclustions, including the decoupling of the
mass-luminosity relation during core H burning and the metallicity
threshold for PISNe, which it finds to be Z_sun/20. Finally, it
acknowledges the complexity of rotation physics that present
complications for current stellar codes.

Special note: I am using these winds to model VFTS 243. Hopefully, I
can get it to work one of these days.

And no. I am not going to write a special note for all of these. I'll
probably do the Pablo one tomorrow though, so I guess I will for that
one.
