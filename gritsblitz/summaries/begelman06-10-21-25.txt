At the time of publication (2006), there were many hypotheses
regarding the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). One of these
theories involves the collapse of supermassive bodies formed directly
out of dense gas with low angular momentum possibly caused by
radiation drag against the CMB at large redshifts. This process can
drive angular momentum out of gas clouds via torque that causes the
radius to shrink, further amplifying the process. Eventually, a
"quasi-star" is formed maintained through radiation pressure.

This quasi-star is expected to have a radius on the order of 1 AU with
temperatures >10^9 K. At this point, thermal neutrino emission causes
catastrophic cooling, creating a 10-20 Msun BH in the core of the
quasistar. It then accretes the surrounding gas at a rate exceeding
the Eddington limit, eventually producing a BH with M > 10^6
Msun. This effect may be limited by the presence of a violent
encounter, mass depletion, or gravitational recoil


Special note: Why did I choose to write about a 2006 paper on
quasi-stars? You will see tomorrow...
