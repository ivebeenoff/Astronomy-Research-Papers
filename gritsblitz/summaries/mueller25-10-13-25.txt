This manuscript attempts to indentify possible candidates for dormant
black holes from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), including candidates cut
from the strict quality cuts subjected to the published Gaia NSS
catalogue. Outside of one serendipitous lensing observation, all black
holes discovered in nature exist in binaries. Before 2023, these were
detected via X-ray emission or GWs. Unfortunately, both of these
detection methods represent a very rare (<<1%) type of black hole. DR3
has discovered three black holes through astrometry that capture a
much more representative black hole sample.

Since the NSS catalogue of published orbital solutions has strict
quality controls regarding noise and resolution, many potential
dormant BH features are not present in it. Nevertheless, our lack of
examples motivates us to individually consider dormant BH not given
orbital solutions, made possible by the fact that DR3 already offers
powerful diagnostics for identifying binaries with massive companions
through summary diagnostics. This paper finds 556 RGB stars that could
feature BH companions. Spectroscopic follow-up is essential to
validate the candidates considered in this paper.
