The previous consensus that stellar mass black holes were
overwhelmingly ejected from their globular clusters (GCs) has been
challenged by the abundant detections of BHs in GCs. Recent studies
have shown the energy generated by binary BHs delays the dynamical
evolution of the GC. However, the early retention or ejection of BHs
due to natal kicks and the distribution of kick velocities are still
matters of intense investigation. Different simulations are used to
search for BHs in GCs, but their search biased by the perscriptions
each simulation adopts, critically so for probes into a single
observable. This single-author paper uses Monte Carlo simulations run
with MOCCA to investigate the evolution of stars after 13 Gyr for two
BH natal kick velocities. The results of these simulations suggest
that systems with significantly different parameters can nevertheless
net similar results.
